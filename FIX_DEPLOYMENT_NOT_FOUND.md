# 🚨 Fix: DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND Error

## The Problem
Error `DEPLOYMENT_NOT_FOUND` means Vercel can't find your deployment. The deployment likely failed or the URL is incorrect.

## 🔍 Step 1: Check Your Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Look for your project - it might be named differently
3. Check if you see any projects at all

## 🚨 If No Projects Show Up:
The deployment probably failed. Let's redeploy properly:

### Option A: Redeploy from Terminal (Recommended)
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/natures_way_soil_website/app
vercel --prod
```

**Important**: When prompted:
- **What's your project name?** → `natures-way-soil` 
- **In which directory is your code located?** → `.` (just press Enter)
- **Want to override the settings?** → `N` (No)

### Option B: Check What URL You Actually Got
After running `vercel --prod`, it will show you the REAL URL. It might be different than what you expected.

## 🔍 Step 2: Find Your Real Project URL
1. Go to [vercel.com/dashboard](https://vercel.com/dashboard)
2. Click on your project (whatever it's actually named)
3. You'll see the real URL at the top
4. Test that URL instead

## 🚀 Step 3: Complete Fresh Deployment
If nothing works, let's start fresh:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/natures_way_soil_website/app

# Login again to make sure
vercel login

# Deploy with specific settings
vercel --prod --name natures-way-soil
```

## 📋 Expected Output
You should see something like:
```
🔗  Linked to your-username/natures-way-soil
🔍  Inspect: https://vercel.com/your-username/natures-way-soil/XXXXXXX
✅  Production: https://natures-way-soil-your-username.vercel.app
```

## ⚠️ Common Issues:
- URL might be `natures-way-soil-YOUR-USERNAME.vercel.app` instead
- Project might be named differently in dashboard
- Deployment might have failed silently

## 🎯 What to Do Next:
1. Try redeploying with the commands above
2. Check your Vercel dashboard for the actual project name/URL
3. Test the REAL URL you get from Vercel
4. Then add environment variables to the correct project

Let me know what URL you actually get after redeploying!
