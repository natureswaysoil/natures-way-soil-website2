# ðŸš¨ Fix: Default Next.js Page Instead of Your Website

## The Problem
You're seeing the default Next.js welcome page instead of your Nature's Way Soil website. This means Vercel deployed the wrong content.

## ðŸ”§ Quick Fix Steps:

### Step 1: Redeploy with Correct Settings
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/natures_way_soil_website/app
vercel --prod --force
```

**When prompted, answer exactly:**
- **Set up and deploy?** â†’ `Y` (Yes)
- **Which scope?** â†’ Choose your account
- **Link to existing project?** â†’ `Y` (Yes) 
- **What's the name of your existing project?** â†’ `natures-way-soil`
- **In which directory is your code located?** â†’ `.` (just press Enter)
- **Want to override the settings?** â†’ `N` (No)

### Step 2: Alternative - Delete and Redeploy Fresh
If that doesn't work:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/natures_way_soil_website/app
vercel --prod --name natures-way-soil-v2
```

This creates a new deployment with a slightly different name.

## ðŸŽ¯ What Should Happen:
After successful deployment, you'll get a URL like:
- `https://natures-way-soil.vercel.app` 
- OR `https://natures-way-soil-v2.vercel.app`

## âœ… Success Indicators:
When it works, you'll see:
- **Nature's Way Soil** branding (not "NEXT.JS")
- **Green color scheme**
- **Product listings** 
- **Navigation menu**
- **AI chatbot** in bottom right

## ðŸš¨ If Still Having Issues:
The deployment might be pointing to an empty directory. Try:

```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/natures_way_soil_website/app
ls -la app/page.tsx
```

This should show your custom homepage file.

## ðŸ“ž Next Steps:
1. Try the redeploy command above
2. Test the new URL
3. If it works, update your Square domain forwarding to the new URL
4. Add environment variables to the new deployment if needed
